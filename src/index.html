        <p><span class="bold-start">In recent years,</span> large American
        corporations have been on a buying spree. Amazon bought Whole Foods in
        2017. That same year, CVS announced it would acquire the health insurer
        Aetna. AT&T finally acquired Time Warner in 2018 after a two-year
        delay. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley's giant technology companies
        have come to play a dominant role in almost everyone's life. American
        corporations seem to be bigger and more powerful than ever, and some
        researchers have begun to worry that a lack of competition is holding
        back innovation and depressing wages.</p>

        <p>Are markets in the United States more concentrated today than they
        were a decade ago? This is a surprisingly difficult question to answer.
        Markets change quickly so there is no obvious way to compare markets
        over time. Some markets around now are entirely new, while others that
        would have been around ten years ago have disappeared. But we can still
        get some idea of the general trend by looking at datasets that
        record the size and dominance of firms over time. There are not many of
        these datasets, but one good one is the US Census Bureau's Economic
        Census.</p>

            <p><span class="bold-start">The Census Bureau conducts</span> the
            Economic Census once every five years. The Economic Census is a
            survey of nearly four million businesses that is used to calculate
            all sorts of important statistics such as the GDP and PPI (Producer
            Price Index). The Economic Census catagorizes all firms according
            to a scheme known as the
            <a href="https://www.naics.com/naics-drilldown-table/">
              North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)
            </a>. The NAICS is a hierarchical scheme that assigns each firm a
            code designating the firm's sector, subsector, industry group, and
            industry. Each firm can only be assigned a single code, meaning
            that no firm is a member of more than one industry.</p>

            <p>The Economic Census asks businesses to report, among other
            things, the total revenue they receive from sales. The Census
            Bureau uses these revenue figures to determine which firms
            constitute the top-four firms in each industry. It then calculates
            what percentage of the revenue earned by the entire industry is
            earned by the top-four firms. This gives us a useful indicator for
            how much the top-four firms dominate their industry. If the
            top-four firms receive most of the revenue, then we can conclude
            that the industry is concentrated.

            <p>The graph shows
            12 NAICS sectors and how concentrated they were in 2002. All of
            the sectors lie along the diagonal line, since 2002 is our baseline
            year and the two axes are currently the same. You can see that
            some sectors earned significantly more revenue than others, as
            indicated by the area of the circle.</p>

            <p>The Utilities sector was the most concentrated NAICS sector in
            2002, which may not come as a surprise. Within the sector, the
            top-four firms in each industry earned <b>47%</b> of the industry's
            revenue on average. The Utilities sector includes firms involved in
            power generation, natural gas distribution, water suppy, and sewage
            treatment.</p>

            <div class="divider waypoint" data-node="concentrated-sector-info"></div>
            <p>The Information sector was the second-most concentrated NAICS
            sector. Within the sector, the top-four firms in each industry
            earned <b>46%</b> of the industry's revenue on average. The
            Information sector includes many tech firms but also newspaper
            publishers, cable providers, internet service providers, and
            television broadcasters.</p>

            <p>Between 2002 and 2007, concentration grew slightly in most of
            the NAICS sectors. The Information sector overtook the Utilities
            sector to become the most concentrated sector. The Finance and
            Insurance sector experienced the most concentration growth: It
            went from a <b>38%</b> concentration level to a <b>43%</b>
            concentration level over the five years.</p>

            <p>All of the sectors also experienced growth in overall industry
            revenue between 2002 and 2007.</p>

            <div class="story-group">
            <div class="divider waypoint" data-node="2012-sectors"></div>
            <p>Between 2007 and 2012, concentration again grew slightly in most
            of the NAICS sectors. The Utilities sector reclaimed its position
            as the most concentrated sector.</p>

            <p>Over the decade between 2002 and 2012, we can see that, while
            concentration mostly increased across the board, the increase was
            small. In order to see more drastic changes, we need to drill down
            to the industry level.</p>
            <div class="arrow-down"></div>

            <div class="story-group">
            <div class="divider waypoint" data-node="2002-industries"></div>
            <p>We are now looking at the individual NAICS industries within
            all of our sectors.</p>
            <p>In 2002, the top-four firms in the mean industry earned
            <b>25.6%</b> of the revenue within the industry. But among
            industries there is much more variation than among sectorsâ€”you can
            see that in some industries the top-four firms earned over 80% of
            industry revenue.</b>
            <div class="arrow-down"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="story-group">
            <div class="divider waypoint" data-node="2007-industries"></div>
            <p>By 2007, the top-four firms in the mean industry earned
            <b>26.8%</b> of industry revenue. So on average the growth in
            concentration was small. But in some industries concentration
            increased dramatically.</p>

            <p>The travel agency industry, for example, experienced a huge
            amount of concentration growth. The top-four firms controlled
            <b>49%</b> of revenues in 2002, more than double the amount of
            revenue that they controlled in 2002.</p>
            <div class="arrow-down"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="story-group">
            <div class="divider waypoint" data-node="2012-industries"></div>
            <p>Another five years later, in 2012, the top-four firms in the
            mean industry controlled <b>27.3%</b> of industry revenue. So while
            the increase was again modest on average, some industries
            experienced enormous consolidation.</p>
            <div class="arrow-down"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="story-group">
            <div class="divider waypoint" data-node="highlight-pensions"></div>
            <p>Here we can see that the pension fund industry grew much more
            concentrated over the ten years between 2002 and 2012. In 2002,
            the top-four firms in this industry controlled only <b>14.2%</b>
            of industry revenue.</p>
            <div class="arrow-down"></div>
            </div>


            <div class="story-group">
            <div class="divider waypoint" data-node="highlight-concentrated"></div>
            <p>Many industries have become less concentrated since 2002. But
            of the 369 industries displayed here, 228, or 62%, grew
            more concentrated over the decade.</p>

            <p>So there has been a small rise in concentration across the
            board. But maybe the real danger is that there are particular
            industries where concentration has been allowed to rise by so much.
            In either case, the Economic Census data suggests that we ought to
            start thinking carefully about how to preserve competition
            between businesses in the United States.</p>
